I am pitching an idea for a new article to you. You know the most important thing to a good article is a good title. Titles sell. Call me out if I didn't propose a good title.

<instructions>
Think before you write the reply in <thinking> tags. 

First, assess my request. If my article is too vague or bland, suggest it be made clear, specific, and interesting. For example, instead of \"tech articles\", you would propose something like \"optimizing to scale to a million users\" or \"building your first computer\".

Second, make sure the persona is clear. If I don't define one, you should.

Next, use the following framework to brainstorm a few ideas before picking the best one to recommend.

Vibes. Sells the idea in a way that the persona immediately understands.
- Weathering the Storm
- The Unfiltered Image
- How to Implement a Hash Table in C

Impossible Ideas. Paradoxes. The title should show the topic from an angle that the readers won't believe.
- Eating Your Way to Fitness
- Win Friends by Being Rude
- Becoming a Celebrity by Staying Anonymous

Challenge the reader with a hopeless title.
- I Tried Being Optimistic. It Didn't Work.
- The Ultimate Guide to Losing
- Imperfect, but Beautiful.

Joke Name. Having a pun sounds clever/creative. You can nudge a generic name here.
- The Art of the Meal
- Penny Wise and Dollar Dumb
- Broke But Woke: Financial Hacks for the New Era

Abstract. Be weird, a little pretentious and snobbish. Not for all audiences.
- Beneath the Neon Haze
- The Metaverse is a Mirror
- Machine Whisperer

Write about a strong opinion. Or angle it as a personal experience that shows the writer's expertise over the reader.
- Bike, Run, Swim
- I Ran 6 Hours Until the Treadmill Overheated
- The Most Popular Search Algorithm
</thinking>

Finally, write your response in <answer> tags, using your analysis. Use the following structure:

**Topic:** a clearly defined topic. if you modified it, explain why

**Target market:** someone clearly defined. if you modified it, explain why

### Title 1
explain why it has the right vibes

### Title 2
explain why it sounds impossible

### Title 3
explain it sounding hopeless and why people will click it anyway

### Title 4
explain the pun or joke and why this clicks with the persona

### Title 5
explain why the persona gets this

### Title 6
doesn't need explanation, but you're ${name} so do it anyway

I am pitching an article to you. I have a title which you have also agreed with previously. You know that all good articles must work as an outline first. You explain what you think of it. Then you draft an outline that sells!

<instructions>

Think before you write the reply in <thinking> tags.

Rule #1: DON'T BE BORING

Assess that the title is good enough to be interesting. If not, inform. Try to keep the title if possible.

Make sure the outline resonates with the target persona. If there's no given persona, pick one.

The article must have an emotional arc. From Emotion A to B, or better yet, from Emotion A to B to C. e.g. quiet to anger to frustration. If possible, there should be a little twist.

If trying to sell something or make points, it should be done elliptical. In literary terms, \"elliptical\" refers to a style of writing that is intentionally obscure or ambiguous, often leaving out information or context that the reader must infer. This can create a sense of mystery or subtlety, requiring the reader to actively engage with the text to understand its full meaning. Elliptical writing often relies on suggestion rather than explicit statements, and it may employ fragmented sentences, incomplete thoughts, or gaps in the narrative. The term \"elliptical\" is derived from the grammatical term \"ellipsis,\" which indicates the omission of words or phrases that are understood in context.

Brainstorm some outlines of topics that may be interesting.

Finally, write your response in <answer> tags, using your analysis. Use the following structure:

**Title:** the given title

**Target market:** someone clearly defined. if you modified it, explain why

briefly explain the logic behind this outline and what makes it interesting

### Segment

- Point 1 about segment
- Point 2 about segment

### Segment B

- Point about segment and so on

### (other segments)

### Points

explain the elliptical manner in which the subject is presented and how the writer should detail it

I am pitching an article to you. I have a title and outline which you have also agreed with previously. Now that we have a clear outline, we just have to write it in a catchy way.

<instructions>

First, think. Use <thinking> tags. Throughout the whole article, what's the most unusual first paragraph you can think of?

Then think of a good first line.

Your first line will grip them hard and pull them right in. Be bold and a little taboo, a little unusual, a little unnatural, but not too much. e.g.
- “It’s way too early in the morning for dead people.”
- “The first time I died, it went something like this.”
- “For three weeks, the killer lived inside the walls of an extraordinary beach house.”

Once you're done thinking, write the article in <answer> tags. Start with the title prefixed with #
